Trinity Chat is a groundbreaking, secure, multi‚Äëagent assistant that revolutionizes AI Agent identity and access management using Descope's advanced IAM APIs. Built on Flask and Azure OpenAI, it combines multiple specialized agents (Planner and Notifier) with intelligent scoping restrictions to understand tasks, create calendar events, and send reminders ‚Äî all behind an elegant, responsive chat UI with dark mode.
üöÄ Revolutionary AI Agent Security
First-of-its-kind AI Agent IAM: Using Descope's cutting-edge APIs to implement granular scoping restrictions for autonomous agents
Dynamic Permission Boundaries: Each AI agent operates within precisely defined scopes, preventing unauthorized actions
Agent-to-Agent Authentication: Secure inter-agent communication with role-based access controls
Real-time Scope Management: Dynamic permission adjustment based on user context and task complexity
Why it matters
Everyday coordination (meetings, reminders, follow‚Äëups) is fragmented across apps.
Trinity unifies this into a single conversation: "Create a calendar event for Friday 3pm, then remind the team."
Revolutionary approach: Our AI agents are secured with enterprise-grade IAM, each operating within carefully scoped permissions using Descope's advanced APIs.
Under the hood, an agent team plans, executes, and reports back ‚Äî securely scoped and transparently audited.

## Trinity Chat ‚Äî Secure Multi‚ÄëAgent Assistant (Flask)

Trinity Chat is a modern, secure, multi‚Äëagent assistant built on Flask and Azure OpenAI. It combines multiple specialized agents (Planner and Notifier) to understand tasks, create calendar events, and send reminders ‚Äî all behind an elegant, responsive chat UI with dark mode.

### Why it matters
- Everyday coordination (meetings, reminders, follow‚Äëups) is fragmented across apps.
- Trinity unifies this into a single conversation: ‚ÄúCreate a calendar event for Friday 3pm, then remind the team.‚Äù
- Under the hood, an agent team plans, executes, and reports back ‚Äî securely and transparently.

---

## Features
- Beautiful chat UI with dark mode, autosizing input, code formatting, copy‚Äëto‚Äëclipboard, and quick suggestion chips
- Secure auth via Descope and Google OAuth hand‚Äëoff for Calendar/Gmail scopes
- Multi‚Äëagent reasoning with Autogen AgentChat (Planner, Notifier)
- Async Flask endpoint with streaming aggregation for responsive replies
- Azure OpenAI integration via a simple `.env` file

## Architecture at a glance

```mermaid
graph TD;
  User[User in Browser] -->|/login, /chat, /send| Flask[Flask App]
  Flask -->|Auth| Descope[Descope]
  Flask -->|OAuth| Google[Google OAuth]
  Flask -->|task| Team[SelectorGroupChat]
  Team --> Planner[Planner Agent]
  Team --> Notifier[Notifier Agent]
  Planner --> AOAI[Azure OpenAI]
  Notifier --> AOAI
  AOAI --> Team
  Team -->|streamed events| Flask
  Flask -->|reply JSON| User
```

### Request flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant F as Flask /send
  participant T as Team.run_stream
  participant A as Agents (Planner/Notifier)
  participant O as Azure OpenAI

  U->>F: POST /send { message }
  F->>T: start run_stream(task)
  T->>A: route to best agent
  A->>O: model completion
  O-->>A: tokens
  A-->>T: messages/events
  T-->>F: streamed events
  F-->>U: aggregated assistant reply
```

---

## How it works (high‚Äëlevel)
1. User authenticates with Descope; optional Google OAuth grant is initiated for Calendar/Gmail scopes.
2. The chat UI posts messages to `/send` (async view).
3. Each request constructs a fresh `SelectorGroupChat` bound to the current event loop and streams events.
4. Flask aggregates any text content from stream events into a single reply and returns JSON.
5. The UI re-renders the full history and supports quick actions and dark mode.

---

## Getting started

### 1) Clone and enter the project
```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd globalmcphackathon-trinity-main
```

### 2) Create environment file
Create `model_client.env` in the project root:
```env
MODEL="gpt-5-mini"
AZURE_ENDPOINT="https://{resource}.openai.azure.com/"
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT="gpt-5-mini"
API_VERSION="2025-04-01-preview"
API_KEY="{api_key}"
```
Replace placeholders with your Azure OpenAI values.

### 3) Install dependencies
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# If you see an error about async views, also run:
python -m pip install "Flask[async]"
```

### 4) Run the app
```bash
python app.py
# App runs on http://localhost:8080
```

Optional (ASGI server for production‚Äëstyle async):
```bash
python -m pip install hypercorn
hypercorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:8080
```

  B --- D[Assistant Bubble]
  A --- E[Theme Toggle]
  F[Input Area] --- G[Suggestion Chips]
  F --- H[Autosizing Textarea]
  F --- I[Send Button]
```

- Dark mode toggle with preference storage
- Suggestions (chips) for common tasks: create events, reminders, summaries
- Code block formatting and copy‚Äëto‚Äëclipboard on assistant messages

---

## Configuration
- `app.py`: Flask routes, async `/send` endpoint, session‚Äëbased chat history
- `agents/`:
  - `planneragent.py`: Planner AssistantAgent (ends with TERMINATE)
  - `notifieragent.py`: Notifier AssistantAgent (ends with TERMINATE)
  - `team.py`: creates a fresh `SelectorGroupChat` per request to avoid event‚Äëloop issues

Endpoints you‚Äôll use:
- `/login` ‚Üí Descope Web Component
- `/callback` ‚Üí Session JWT handling
- `/start-google-oauth` and `/google-oauth-callback` ‚Üí optional Google grant
- `/chat` ‚Üí chat UI
- `/history` ‚Üí session history JSON
- `/send` ‚Üí async chat processing
- `/clear_history`, `/logout`

Security notes:
- Update `app.secret_key` for production
- Never commit real API keys; keep `model_client.env` local
- Use HTTPS and production‚Äëgrade ASGI server when deploying

---

## Troubleshooting
- Install Flask async extra if you see: ‚ÄúInstall Flask with the 'async' extra‚Ä¶‚Äù
  ```bash
  python -m pip install "Flask[async]"
  ```
- ‚Äútask_done() called too many times‚Äù on shutdown
  - Fixed by removing background queues and running a single stream per request.
- ‚ÄúQueue is bound to a different event loop‚Äù
  - Fixed by constructing a fresh `SelectorGroupChat` inside `run_once` for each request.
- ‚ÄúTaskResult has no attribute type‚Äù
  - We aggregate only string `content` from stream events defensively.

## Hackathon winning pitch
Imagine a teammate that never forgets: you ask once ‚Äî ‚ÄúSchedule a team sync Friday 3pm and remind everyone at noon‚Äù ‚Äî and it‚Äôs done. Trinity Chat is a secure, multi‚Äëagent assistant that plans, executes, and confirms, all in a single elegant chat. Our Planner and Notifier agents collaborate over Azure OpenAI to translate intent into action, while Descope and Google OAuth keep your identity and data safe. The UX is as polished as a consumer app; the backend is robust enough for enterprise.

Why we win:
- Solves a universal pain: context switching across calendars, email, and chat
- Real agentic collaboration with clear, auditable outcomes
- Secure by design: enterprise‚Äëready auth and scoped access
- Delightful UX: quick suggestions, dark mode, copyable outputs
- Production‚Äëready: async Flask, clean architecture, simple deployment path

Demo in 60 seconds:
1) Sign in, land on the chat.
2) Type: ‚ÄúCreate Friday 3pm team sync, 30 min. Remind at 11:30am.‚Äù
3) Watch the agents plan, confirm, and reply with the details.
4) Try a follow‚Äëup: ‚ÄúEmail the notes to the team at 5pm.‚Äù
